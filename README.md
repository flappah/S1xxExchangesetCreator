# S1xxExchangesetCreator
A command line tool to generate exchange sets based on an input GMLfile

This project will eventually deliver a full scale exchangset generator for IHO S1xx files. 

It is based on the .NET Core 3.1 language and is therefore able to be ran on different .NET platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux).
